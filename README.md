# 📂 Create React Folder Structure CLI

## 🌟 Description

Welcome to `create-react-folder`! This CLI tool is your quick fix to setting up a well-organized folder structure for React applications. It ensures that you can start your project with the best practices in folder organization, complete with `.gitkeep` files to keep your directories tidy in version control.

## 🚀 Features

- **Quick Setup**: Get a complete folder structure set up with just one command.
- **Standardization**: Ensures consistent folder architecture, making it easier for teams to collaborate.
- **.gitkeep Integration**: Automatically adds `.gitkeep` files in empty directories.

## 📦 Installation

Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-folder
```

Or, install it globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-folder
```

## 🛠 Usage

Simply navigate to the root of your React project and execute:

```bash
npx create-react-folder
```

This will create the following structure:

```
